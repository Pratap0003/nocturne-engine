# Nocturne Engine — Ethics Statement

## Purpose
Nocturne Engine is a fictional narrative system.
It creates symbolic prose for reflection, not belief.

## Explicit Boundaries
This system does NOT:
- Diagnose mental health
- Predict future outcomes
- Influence behavior
- Adapt based on emotional response

## User Agency
- Consent is mandatory
- Audio requires user action
- Accessibility mode removes atmosphere
- No data is stored

## Design Philosophy
Narrative over instruction.
Symbol over authority.
Ambiguity over control.

If a system removes your ability to disagree,
it has crossed into manipulation.
